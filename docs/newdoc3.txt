Yes, this corresponds exactly to the 256-byte (2048-bit) RSA Signature block from the end of the certificate you provided earlier.
In the context of your MAG Server Emulator, here is exactly what this block does, how the real server used it, and how you should handle it.
1. What this data represents
This block is the Cryptographic Seal of the certificate.
• Who created it: The SCERT Root Authority (Sony's internal Certificate Authority).
• How it was made: Sony took the rest of the certificate (the info about "Zipper Interactive," "MAG," and the expiration dates), calculated a SHA-1 hash of it, and encrypted that hash using the SCERT Root Private Key.
• The content: If you could decrypt this block using the Sony Root Public Key, you would find a tiny 20-byte SHA-1 hash (plus some padding bytes).
2. How the Real Server used it
When the official Sony servers were live, this is the logic they ran the moment they received this packet:
1. Receive: Server gets the 0x24 packet.
2. Extract: Server pulls out this 256-byte signature block.
3. Decrypt: Server uses the stored SCERT Root Public Key to decrypt this block.
4. Verify:
• Result of Decryption = Hash A
• Server calculates its own SHA-1 hash of the certificate body = Hash B
• If Hash A == Hash B: "This is a legitimate copy of MAG."
• If Hash A != Hash B: "This is a hacked client or modified EBOOT. BAN."
3. How YOUR Emulator should handle it
Since you are building a custom server, you have a massive advantage: You are the boss. You do not strictly need to verify this signature unless you want to block cheaters.
Option A: The "Lazy" Path (Recommended for now)
Your emulator can simply ignore this signature block.
• Receive the packet.
• Parse the User ID or Session Key to know who is connecting.
• Skip the math.
• Send back the "OK" response (likely the 0x25 packet).
• Benefit: You don't need to hunt down the Sony Root Public Key.
Option B: The "Hardcore" Path (True Emulation)
If you want to verify it mathematically (e.g., to ensure only "pure" game dumps can connect), you need the SCERT Root CA Certificate.
• This certificate is usually embedded in the PS3 firmware files (dev_flash) or sometimes inside the EBOOT.BIN itself.
• Without that Root Key (Modulus), this 256-byte block is just random noise.
4. Code to Handle this Packet
Since you are emulating the server, here is how you would process this specific signature block in Python.
