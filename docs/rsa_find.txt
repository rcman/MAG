Based on the hex dump provided, this is a Sony PlayStation Network (PSN) internal client certificate, specifically used by the PlayStation 3 game "MAG" (Massive Action Game).
The file structure consists of a custom 17-byte proprietary header followed by a standard X.509 Certificate (encoded in DER format).
Here is the detailed breakdown of the data.
1. Header Analysis (Custom Sony Protocol)
The first 17 bytes (0x00 - 0x10) appear to be a custom application-layer framing header, likely used by the game's networking library (e.g., libssl or a custom RPC wrapper) to handshake with the game servers.
• Message Type: 0x24 (Client Certificate)
• Payload Length: 0xD4 02 (Little Endian) = 724 bytes.
• Verification: File size (727) - Header overhead (3 bytes) = 724. Matches perfectly.
• Padding/Flags: The bytes 01 00 70... to ...c2 02 likely represent protocol versioning or connection flags specific to the Sony network libraries of that era (circa 2005).
2. X.509 Certificate Analysis
The standard SSL certificate begins at offset 0x11 (byte 30 82 02 be).
Identity (Subject)
This section identifies who owns this certificate (the game client).
• Country (C): USA
• State (ST): CA
• Locality (L): San Diego
• Organization (O): SCEA (Sony Computer Entertainment America)
• Organizational Unit (OU): Zipper
• Context: Zipper Interactive was the developer of the game MAG.
• Common Name (CN): MAG 2023
• Context: "MAG" is the game title. "2023" is likely an internal project ID, server cluster ID, or build number (unrelated to the year 2023, as this was issued in 2005).
Issuer (Authority)
This section identifies who signed the certificate.
• Organization (O): SONY Computer Entertainment America Inc.
• Organizational Unit (OU): SCERT Group
• Common Name (CN): SCERT Root Authority
• Context: This is Sony's internal Root CA used for authenticating games and consoles on the PSN dev/production environments.
Validity Period
• Not Before: 051122002629Z -> November 22, 2005
• Not After: 351121235959Z -> November 21, 2035
• Observation: The certificate has a 30-year lifespan, typical for embedded console certificates that cannot be easily updated on physical discs.
Cryptographic Details
• Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption (PKCS #1)
• Key Strength: 512-bit (Modulus length 64 bytes)
• Security Note: A 512-bit RSA key is extremely weak and was considered insecure even by 2010 standards. However, it was often used in the PS2/PS3 era for performance reasons on the game console's limited processor.
• Exponent: 17 (0x11)
• Note: A very small public exponent. While standard is usually 65537, using 17 makes encryption operations slightly faster.
• Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
• Signature Size: 2048-bit (256 bytes)
• Observation: While the game's key is weak (512-bit), the Root CA that signed it used a strong 2048-bit key.
