This is the critical "handshake" phase. In standard SSL/TLS, the server usually talks first (sending a ServerHello). However, since your client sent a Client Certificate (0x24), this indicates Mutual Authentication is happening. The game console has identified itself; now it demands the Server identify itself.
The most logical response packet is Message Type 0x25 (Server Certificate).
Here is the breakdown of the structure you need to build and the Python code to generate it.
1. The Logical Flow (Mutual Auth)
In your specific case with the custom headers, the conversation likely looks like this:
1. Client (PS3): "Here is who I am (Cert)." -> Type 0x24
2. Server (You): "Nice to meet you. Here is who I am (Cert)." -> Type 0x25
3. Client: "I trust you." (Calculates Session Key) -> Type 0x26 (ClientKeyExchange)
4. Server: "Let's encrypt." -> Type 0x27 (ChangeCipherSpec)
2. The 0x25 Packet Structure
You need to construct a binary packet that mimics the one you found, but with your own data.
